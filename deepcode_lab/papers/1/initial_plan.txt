         * Network: Fully connected layers with custom size
       - Training objective:
         * J(θ) = maxη(π̄)
         * Modified reward: R'(st,at) = R(st,at) + α*am_t
         * α = 0.0001 (blinding bonus coefficient)

    2. Mixed State Distribution (distribution/mixer.py):
       - Implementation:
         * μ(s) = β*dˆπρ(s) + (1-β)*ρ(s)
         * β = p (mixing probability, 0.25-0.5)
       - Sampling logic:
         * Default state sampling from environment
         * Critical state identification and storage
         * Probability-based mixing mechanism

    3. RND Exploration (exploration/rnd_networks.py):
       - Networks:
         * Target: Fixed random network f(s)
         * Predictor: Trainable network f̂(s)
       - Bonus calculation:
         * RRND_t = ||f(st+1) - f̂(st+1)||²
         * Normalized bonus with λ = 0.01
       - Training:
         * MSE loss for predictor network
         * Moving average normalization

    4. Policy Refinement (refinement/ppo.py):
       - PPO implementation:
